# Fix for Vercel 404 Error

## Problem
When deploying your React application to Vercel, you're encountering a 404 NOT_FOUND error. This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) deployed on Vercel.

## Solution
I've added a `vercel.json` configuration file to your project that properly handles routing for your React SPA.

## Steps to Fix

1. The `vercel.json` file has been created with the proper configuration for your React application.

2. Commit and push the changes to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add vercel.json configuration for SPA routing"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Redeploy your application on Vercel.

## What the vercel.json does

The configuration file:
- Tells Vercel to build your frontend application using the static build preset
- Configures routing so that all requests are directed to your React app's index.html
- This allows React Router to handle client-side routing properly

## Additional Notes

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Make sure your Vercel project is configured to use the correct root directory (should be the project root, not the frontend directory)
2. Check that your build command in Vercel settings is `npm run build` (executed in the frontend directory)
3. Verify that your output directory in Vercel is set to `frontend/build`


## Vercel Error Handling

This project includes utilities and documentation for handling Vercel-specific errors:

- [Vercel Error Codes Documentation](./docs/VERCEL_ERROR_CODES.md) - Comprehensive list of Vercel error codes with their categories and HTTP status codes
- [Vercel Error Handler Utility](./frontend/src/utils/vercelErrorHandler.js) - Frontend utility for handling Vercel errors in React components

The error handler utility provides:
- Functions to get error information by error code
- Helper functions to determine if an error is an application or platform error
- User-friendly error messages for better UX
- Integration with React state management for displaying errors

For platform errors (500 status codes), contact Vercel support as they indicate issues with the Vercel platform itself.
